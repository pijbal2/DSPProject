# DSPProject
Repository for the DSP module project.

Since I was doing the analysis in quite an untidy way (figured I'd just do everything on a couple of main python files, local install of jupyter was also not working at the time and AI notebook didn't handle large file sizes),
the files aren't the cleanest and I had lost quite a bit of what I'd done, simply because I kept changing the main file itself. I also lost the R code for the three time series graphs, and since they were very simple forecasts not requiring too much transforming, I left them out, and did my best to reconstruct the Python code for what it was.

The main file has the main transformations I had done to the pet files, as well as with files about buildings with three or more flats / two or less flats there and tne population file, which was transformed in a different file (PopulationDataTransforms). 
All the model stuff is in the file MLPetData.py

Some simple visualizations were also done in the Power BI file.
